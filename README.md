# Monthly Revenue Forecasting — Time Series SARIMA Model (Python)

This project performs time series forecasting on monthly U.S. retail sales data using a SARIMA model.
The goal is to analyze long-term trends, seasonality patterns, and generate a 12-month future forecast of retail revenue.

The pipeline includes:

* Data cleaning & preprocessing
* Exploratory time-series analysis
* STL decomposition
* Stationarity testing (ADF)
* SARIMA hyperparameter search (AIC-based)
* Train/Test evaluation
* Final model training & 12-month forecast
* Saving & loading a trained model artifact
* Exporting forecast visualizations

This project is built end-to-end in Python, following real-world best practices for forecasting workflows.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains monthly U.S. retail sales with multiple business categories.
For this project, we extract:

## Retail Sales, Total (Seasonally Adjusted)

because it provides:

* Complete data from 1992–2024
* Strong trend + seasonality (ideal for SARIMA)
* Reliable signal for long-term forecasting

Key columns:

|Column	            |Description|
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
|month	            |Monthly timestamp (YYYY-MM)         |
|kind_of_business   |Retail category                     |
|value	            |Total monthly sales (Millions USD)  |

# Project Workflow
## 1. Load & Clean Data

* Imported CSV from data/raw/
* Filtered to "Retail sales, total"
* Converted month column into datetime

Enforced monthly frequency:
```
ts = df_total.set_index("month").asfreq("MS")
```

## 2. Exploratory Time-Series Analysis

Raw trend visualization

Checked for seasonal cycles

Identified structural breaks (e.g., COVID-19)

3. STL Decomposition (Trend + Seasonality + Residual)

We used STL to separate components:

Long-term economic trend

Strong yearly seasonality (12-month cycle)

Irregular noise spikes (especially 2020)

4. Stationarity Check (ADF Test)

ADF p-value was extremely high:

p ≈ 0.99


➡️ Series is non-stationary
➡️ Differencing required:

First difference: d = 1

Seasonal difference: D = 1 (period = 12)

5. Differencing

Applied:

ts_diff = ts.diff().dropna()
ts_diff_seasonal = ts_diff.diff(12).dropna()


Result: stationarity achieved.

6. SARIMA Hyperparameter Search (AIC Grid Search)

We performed a full grid search over:

p, q ∈ {0, 1, 2}

d = 1

P, Q ∈ {0, 1, 2}

D = 1

Seasonal period = 12

The optimal model (lowest AIC):

order = (1, 1, 2)
seasonal_order = (2, 1, 2, 12)

7. Train/Test Split

We reserved the last 24 months as test dataset.

Trained SARIMA on the historical period and evaluated forecast performance.

Metrics:

MAE

RMSE

MAPE (%)

8. Forecast Visualization (Test Period)

Model forecasts were overlapped with actual values to inspect structural accuracy.

9. Final Model Training (Full Dataset)

SARIMA was retrained on the complete time series.

10. Future Forecast (12 Months)

Generated and visualized forecast for the next 12 months.

Saved the final chart to:

visuals/monthly_retail_sarima_forecast.png

🤖 Model Artifact

The trained model is saved as:

models/sarima_retail_total.pkl


This allows forecasts to be generated without retraining, e.g.:

import joblib

model = joblib.load("models/sarima_retail_total.pkl")
future = model.get_forecast(steps=12)
forecast_mean = future.predicted_mean


This is a critical component of production-ready pipelines.
