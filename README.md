# monthly-revenue-forecasting
Time series forecasting of monthly revenue using Python.

# Overview

This project performs time series forecasting on monthly revenue data using Python.It demonstrates end-to-end forecasting steps:

* Data cleaning
* Exploratory time series analysis
* Stationarity checks (ADF test)
* Model selection (ARIMA / SARIMA / ETS)
* Forecasting future revenue
* Visualising predictions vs actuals

# Technologies Used
